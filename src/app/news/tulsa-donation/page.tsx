            The owners of a Tulsa gas station said they are donating proceeds from the pump to the families of fallen Tulsa police Sergeant Craig Johnson and injured Officer Aurash Zarkeshan.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Raj and Yuba Parajuli, the owners of Perfect Food and Gas said they want to support the ones who protect them, so one cent from each gallon of fuel they sell will go to the officer&apos;s families.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Ed Kurtz stopped at Perfect Food and Gas today near 15th and Harvard and had no idea where his money would be going.
          </p>

          <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-gray-200 pl-4 my-4">
            &quot;Just after I stopped, I found out. It&apos;s great. I&apos;m trying to do all I can to help the police fund, especially for our fallen officers,&quot; said Kurtz.
          </blockquote>

          <p className="mb-4">
            The fundraiser will last all of July at all three Tulsa locations. Kurtz said supporting these officers is extra special to him.
          </p>

          <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-gray-200 pl-4 my-4">
            &quot;It&apos;s very important. I have a stepson who is an officer,&quot; said Kurtz. &quot;You know we worry about him all the time.&quot;
          </blockquote>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Sergeant Johnson was shot and killed during a traffic stop last week. Officer Zarkeshan was also shot during the stop and is still in the hospital, but doctors said he is awake and talking with family.
          </p>

          <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-gray-200 pl-4 my-4">
            &quot;I know we can&apos;t get Craig back, but we want to let their family know that we&apos;re here for them and we thank them for what they did for us,&quot; said Yuba Parajuli, co-owner of Perfect Food and Gas.
          </blockquote>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Yuba and Raj Parajuli have owned Perfect Food and Gas for six years. They said they feel they are a part of this community and that&apos;s why they felt compelled to help and hold the fundraiser.
          </p>

          <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-gray-200 pl-4 my-4">
            &quot;Tulsa Police are the ones who protect us, in this community, day and night, 24/7,&quot; said Parajuli. &quot;We feel like this is the time they need us, and we are here for them. Everyone is coming together to help the people and help the officers.&quot;
          </blockquote>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Several businesses are holding fundraisers to help support the officers&apos; families. Rib Crib in Downtown Tulsa is donating 100% of their proceeds this week to the Tulsa Fraternal Order of Police Benevolence Fund.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            TPD said Sergeant Johnson&apos;s funeral service will be held at Victory Christian Church on Thursday at 1 p.m. They said there will be a visitation at Floral Haven Rose Chapel in Broken Arrow on Wednesday from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m.
